## Clone the repo

- Clone the repo and run `npm install` or `yarn install` to install all the dependencies required for the project.

- Run `npm start` to launch the local server and have fun with it.

### PS

Any suggestion/improvement is welcomed as the app is still not perfect in terms of UI, so feel free to reach.
